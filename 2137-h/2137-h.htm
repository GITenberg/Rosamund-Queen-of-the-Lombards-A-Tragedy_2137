<p class="poetry">This is no matter of the wars: in war<br />
Thy king, old friend, is less than king of thine,<br />
And comrade less than follower.&nbsp; Hast thou loved<br />
Ever&mdash;loved woman, not as chance may love,<br />
But as thou hast loved thy sword or friend&mdash;or me?<br />
Thou hast shewn me love more stout of heart than death.<br />
Death quailed before thee when thou gav&rsquo;st me life,<br />
Borne down in battle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NARSETES.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Woman?&nbsp; As I love<br />
Flowers in their season.&nbsp; A rose is but a rose.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Dost thou know rose from thistle or
bindweed?&nbsp; Man,<br />
Speak as our north wind speaks, if harsh and hard&mdash;<br />
Truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NARSETES.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">White I know from red, and dark from bright,
<br />
And milk from blood in hawthorn-flowers: but not<br />
Woman from woman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">How should God our Lord,<br />
Except his eye see further than his world?<br />
For women ever make themselves anew,<br />
Meseems, to match and mock the maker.&nbsp; Friend,<br />
If ever I were friend of thine in fight,<br />
Speak, and I bid thee not speak truth: I know<br />
Thy tongue knows nought but truth or silence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NARSETES.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Is it<br />
A king&rsquo;s or friend&rsquo;s part, king, to bid his friend<br
/>
Speak what he knows not?&nbsp; Speak then thou, that I<br />
May find thy will and answer it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I am fain<br />
And loth to tell thee how it wrings my heart<br />
That now this hard-eyed heavy southern sun<br />
Hath wrought its will upon us all a year<br />
And yet I know not if my wife be mine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NARSETES.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thy meanest man at arms had known ere dawn<br
/>
Blinked on his bridal birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Did I bid thee<br />
Mock, and forget me for thy friend&mdash;I say not,<br />
King?&nbsp; Is thy heart so light and lean a thing,<br />
So loose in faith and faint in love?&nbsp; I bade thee<br />
Stand to me, help me, hold my hand in thine<br />
And give my heart back answer.&nbsp; This it is,<br />
Old friend and fool, that gnaws my life in twain&mdash;<br />
The worm that writhes and feeds about my heart&mdash;<br />
The devil and God are crying in either ear<br />
One murderous word for ever, night and day,<br />
Dark day and deadly night and deadly day,<br />
Can she love thee who slewest her father?&nbsp; I<br />
Love her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NARSETES.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thy wife should love thee as thy
sire&rsquo;s<br />
Loved him.&nbsp; Thou art worth a woman&mdash;heart for
heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">My sire&rsquo;s wife loved him?&nbsp; Hers he
had not slain.<br />
Would God I might but die and burn in hell<br />
And know my love had loved me!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NARSETES.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Is thy name<br />
Babe?&nbsp; Sweet are babes as flowers that wed the sun,<br />
But man may be not born a babe again,<br />
And less than man may woman.&nbsp; Rosamund<br />
Stands radiant now in royal pride of place<br />
As wife of thine and queen of Lombards&mdash;not<br />
Cunimund&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Hadst thou slain her sire<br />
Shamefully, shame were thine to have sought her hand<br />
And shame were hers to love thee: but he died<br />
Manfully, by thy mightier hand than his<br />
Manfully mastered.&nbsp; War, born blind as fire,<br />
Fed not as fire upon her: many a maid<br />
As royal dies disrobed of all but shame<br />
And even to death burnt up for shame&rsquo;s sake: she<br />
Lives, by thy grace, imperial.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>

Her lord or sire, which hath most part in her,<br />
This hour shall try between us.</p>

<p class="poetry">My sovereign bids her bondman what she

<p class="poetry">Me?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Thy voice was honey-hearted music, sweet<br />
As wine and glad as clarions: not in battle<br />
Might man have more of joy than I to hear it<br />
And feel delight dance in my heart and laugh<br />
Too loud for hearing save its own.&nbsp; Thou rose,<br />
Why did God give thee more than all thy kin<br />
Whose pride is perfume only and colour, this?<br />
Music?&nbsp; No rose but mine sings, and the birds<br />
Hush all their hearts to hearken.&nbsp; Dost thou hear not<br />
How heavy sounds her note now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ROSAMUND.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Sire, not I.<br />
But sire I should not call thee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Surely, no.<br />
I bade thee speak: I did not bid thee sing:<br />
Thou canst not speak and sing not.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ROSAMUND.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Albovine,<br />
I had at heart a simple thing to crave<br />
And thought not on thy flatteries&mdash;as I think not<br />
Now.&nbsp; Knowest thou not my handmaid Hildegard<br />
Free-born, a noble maiden?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And a fair<br />
As ever shone like sundawn on the snows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ROSAMUND.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I had at heart to plead for her with thee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Plead? hast thou found her noble maidenhood<br
/>
Ignobly turned unmaidenlike?&nbsp; I may not<br />
Lightly believe it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ROSAMUND.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Believe it not at all.<br />
Wouldst thou think shame of me&mdash;lightly?&nbsp; She loves<br
/>
As might a maid whose kin were northern gods<br />
The fairest-faced of warriors Lombard born,<br />
Thine Almachildes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">If he loves not her,<br />
More fool is he than warrior even, though war<br />
Have wakened laughter in his eyes, and left<br />
His golden hair fresh gilded, when his hand<br />
Had won the crown that clasps a boy&rsquo;s brows close<br />
With first-born sign of battle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ROSAMUND.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No such fool<br />
May live in such a warrior; if he love not<br />
Some loveliness not hers.&nbsp; No face as bright<br />
Crowned with so fair a Mayflower crown of praise<br />
Lacked ever yet love, if its eyes were set<br />
With all their soul to loveward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALBOVINE.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ay?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

And well he hath served and loves thee.</p>

Hath hearkened when he spake of love&mdash;it may be,<br />
Lightly.</p>

Thy maiden and our natural kin is she.<br />
Wilt thou speak with him&mdash;lightly?</p>

Thy bride will die, shamed.&nbsp; Swear me not again<br />
She shall not: all our trust is set on thee.<br />
What eyes and ears are keen about us here<br />
Thou knowest not.&nbsp; Love, my love and thine for her,<br />
Shall deafen and shall blind them.&nbsp; Be but thou<br />
A bridegroom blind and dumb&mdash;speak soft as love,<br />
And ask not answer louder than a sigh&mdash;<br />
And when to-morrow sets thy bride and thee<br />
Here face to face again, thy soul shall stand<br />
Amazed: thy joy shall turn to wonder.&nbsp; This<br />
Thy queen, whose power may seal her promise fast,<br />
Swears for thine oath again to thee.&nbsp; Good night.</p>

And loathsome as a masked adulterous lie,<br />
Hers would I make him if I might, and yield<br />

The man found lovelier by my love than heaven.</p>

<p class="poetry">This June makes babes of men; last night I
deemed<br />
When thou hadst wished me peace as I passed forth<br />
A footfall pressed behind me soft and fast,<br />
And turning toward it I beheld nought: thee<br />

Turned back toward thee: nought stranger: yet my heart<br />
Sprang, and sank back.&nbsp; I laughed against myself,<br />

Burns life half out within us.&nbsp; Even thine eyes,<br />
Like stars before the wind that brings the cloud,<br />

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
